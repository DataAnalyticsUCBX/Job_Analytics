21356,Broncus Medical Inc.,"THE CHALLENGEAccording to the American Lung Association, lung cancer is the leading cancer killer in both men and women worldwide. In 2010, there were over 150,000 deaths from lung cancer in the United States alone. To diagnose lung cancer, a pulmonologist may order a chest x-ray, a CT scan (a 3-D x-ray), or insert a small tube called a bronchoscope through the nose or mouth to observe the patient’s airways and lungs. The pulmonologist may then take a biopsy of the tumor to examine and diagnose the lung cancer. However, it is currently very difficult to navigate the bronchoscope through redundant, space-constrained airways to take an accurate biopsy.THE COMPANY Broncus Medical has commercialized and continues to develop innovative solutions for diagnosing and treating lung diseases. Physicians use Archimedes Platform to plan bronchoscopic procedures and quickly and accurately access disease tissues in the lungs. Archimedes is a powerful platform for computer-assisted, image-guided bronchoscopic planning and navigation for diagnosing and treatment of lung diseases that is intuitive and easy to use. It provides a map and visual directions through the lung airways to a lung tumor.THE SITUATIONWe are looking for a special person to work with a talented team and take a hands-on role in our Software Development group. This person will be responsible for conducting initial research in machine learning and image processing, conducting experiments, and developing this work into products that help lung cancer patients. We are looking for a strong research and development engineer to work with our team to achieve our objectives.THE IDEAL CANDIDATEThe candidate selected to fill this position will have:• PhD in Computer Science and Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Biomedical Engineering, or Applied Mathematics.• Expertise in Machine Learning, Image Processing, and Image Analysis techniques in the medical domain.
