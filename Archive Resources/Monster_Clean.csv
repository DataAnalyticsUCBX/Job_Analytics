Sr. Machine Learning Scientist Job in Seattle,NA,"Want to be a core member of the next revolution in online payments? Payments on the internet today look largely like they did fifteen years ago, in contrast to every other part of the web. At Amazon we have figured out how to build a massively-scalable payment eco-system. Now we want to bring it to the world and launch the next set of big innovations in the industry! Amazon Payments' vision is that every Amazon customer will pay with Amazon Payments every time and every place s/he transacts anywhere online.

Join us in building platforms and products to protect Amazon and its customers by keeping unlawful activity off Amazon, and then scale your solutions to the exponential growth of Amazon. We are successful when we enable Amazon internal and external customers and sellers to more frictionlessly use our products including Selling on Amazon, Login & Pay with Amazon, Mechanical Turk, and AWS products. And the list is only increasing!

It’s still Day 1, and you have an opportunity to be involved in establishing a platform team that is critical to existing businesses and an enabler for new product launches. We have extremely low operations burden, no legacy software, all of which enables us to focus on strategy and building software. As a leader in our space, you get to put on the strategic hat, work across orgs and consult with the best ML leaders in the world across the company to determine our path forward, and re-define how the Anti-Money Laundering problem is solved.
